# Graduate Assessment Centre Teaching Materials

This repository contains material for delivering the HTML/CSS/JS demo for day 1 of the assessment centre. 

## Materials

There are two code directories within this repo:

- [start_point](code/start_point) contains blank HTML, CSS and JS files named to match what is in the notes
- [completed](code/completed) contains the finished site as it would be if the notes are followed verbatim

There are notes available for each stage:

- [HTML](notes/html.md)
- [CSS](notes/css.md)
- [JavaScript](notes/javascript.md)

Additional documents contain:

- [A bullet-point list of instructions as a guide to the trainer](notes/teaching_bullet_points.md)
- [Links to resources used during the session](notes/teaching_links.md)

The afternoon will have time for candidates to do their own research on related topics or to build on what they make in the morning session. The [additional resources](notes/additional_reading.md) document includes suggestions for what to work on next and a selection of relevant links.

## Setup

1. Action any changes to code arising from previous session. 
2. Update notes to reflect any changes.
3. Create and zip a start point folder containing the three files from [start_point](code/start_point).
4. Export the notes and additional reading markdown files to pdf.
5. Create and zip an end point containing the code from [completed](code/completed) plus the pdfs.
6. Upload the zips to Egnyte.
